# memevey-m68k

memevey-m68k is a single dialog box.

memevey-m68k requires Retro68 to compile. Follow the instructions in CMakeLists.txt to compile it (if you're into that).

The release should work just as well.

pika.r is a file containing a single PICT resource obtained by:
  1. Selecting part of an image in an image editor and copy/pasting it into a ResEdit resource.
  2. Decompiling the resulting ResEdit file with DeRez.
If you know of a better way of getting PICT resources, please tell me!
